CS 6640 Project 1

README.txt is this file.

Project1_main.py contains the code necessary for this project. Read report for documentation on appropriate 
use, care must be taken to appropriately comment certain sections out at a time.

img_proj_1_report.pdf contains my report on the process and outcomes of this project.

cow.png, grandview.png, ridge.png, and legacy_bridge.png are the necessary color images to make this code run.

Concerted effort was made in the code and report to comment the purpose of each line of the program. This should
make the code approachable and navigable by an unfamiliar user.
